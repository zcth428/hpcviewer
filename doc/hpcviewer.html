<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
HPCToolkit provides the <b>hpcviewer</b> browser for interactive examination of 
performance databases. The viewer can be launched from a command line (Linux/Unix platform) or by clicking 
the hpcviewer icon (for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux/Unix platform). The command line syntax is as follows:
<blockquote>
 <pre>hpcviewer [&lt;database-directory&gt;]
 </pre>
</blockquote>
<code>&lt;database-directory&gt;</code> is an optional argument to load a database automatically. 
Without this option, the viewer will prompt the location of a database.
</p>

<h3>Menus</h3>
hpcviewer provides three main menus:
<ul>
  <li><b>File</B>: to organize different activities concerning the database and the program, which consists of several sub-menus:
    <ul>
      <li><b>New window</b>: to create a new hpcviewer independently from the existing hpcviewer. </li>
      <li><b>Open database ...</b>: to load a database on the current hpcviewer.</li>
      <li><b>Preferences ...</b>: to display the setting dialog box.</li>
      <li><b>Exit</b>: to quite hpcviewer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Debug</b>: to display the raw XML file of the database.</li>
  <li><b>Help</b>: to display an information about the viewer. The menu is comprised of three items:
    <ul>
      <li><b>About</b>: to display the brief information about the viewer. </li>
      <li><b>hpcviewer help</b>: this help. If the platform support a browser plug-in, this help will be shown inside the viewer.
      	Otherwise an external browser will be used if exists.</li>
      <li><b>Key assists ...</b>: to display the list of shortcuts available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Figure 1 shows a screenshot of a brower window with 
panes and key controls labeled. The browser supports three different views 
of performance data. The browser window is divided into three panes. We 
first explain the views of performance data and then the role of the different 
panes.

<a name="views"><h2>Views</h2></a>
<p> hpcviewer supports three principal views of an application's performance data: a top-down calling context view, a bottom-up caller's view, 
and a flat view. One selects the desired view by clicking on the corresponding 
view control tab. We briefly describe the three views and their corresponding 
purposes. 
</p>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Calling context view</b>. This top-down view represents the dynamic calling contexts (call paths) in which costs were incurred. Using this view, 
one can explore performance measurements of an application in a top- 
down fashion to understand the costs (We use the term cost rather than simply time since hpcviewer can present a multiplicity 
of measured (e.g. cycles, or cache misses) or derived metrics (e.g. cache miss rates or 
bandwidth consumed) that that are other indicators of execution cost.) incurred by calls to a procedure 
in a particular calling context. <br/>
A calling context for a procedure <b><code>f</code></b> consists of the stack of procedure frames active when the call was made to 
<b><code>f</code></b>. Using this view, one can readily see how much of the application's 
cost was incurred by <b><code>f</code></b> when called from a particular calling context. If 
finer detail is of interest, one can explore how the costs incurred by a call 
to <b><code>f</code></b> in a particular context are divided between <b><code>f</code></b> itself and the procedures
 it calls. HPCToolkit's call path profiler <i>hpcprof</i> and the hpcviewer 
user interface distinguish calling context precisely by individual call 
sites; this means that if a procedure <b><code>g</code></b> contains calls to procedure <b><code>f</code></b> in 
different places, these represent separate calling contexts.
</li> 
<li> <b>Callers view</b>. This bottom up view enables one to look upward along 
call paths. This view is particularly useful for understanding the performance of software components or procedures that are used in more 
than one context. For instance, a message-passing program may call 
<b><code>MPI_Wait</code></b> in many different calling contexts. The cost of any particular call will depend upon the structure of the parallelization in which 
 the call is made. 
 Serialization or load imbalance may cause long waits 
in some calling contexts while other parts of the program may have 
short waits because computation is balanced and communication is 
overlapped with computation. 
</li>
<li><b>Flat view</b>. This view organizes performance measurement data accord- 
ing to the static structure of an application. All costs incurred in any 
calling context by a procedure are aggregated together in the flat view. 
This complements the calling context view, in which the costs incurred 
by a particular procedure are represented separately for each call to 
the procedure from a different calling context. 
</li>
</ul>

<a name="panes"><h2>Panes</h2></a>
<p>The browser window is divided into three panes: the <b>navigation</b> 
pane, the <b>source</b> pane, and the <b>metrics</b> pane. We briefly describe the role of 
each pane. </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Source pane</b>. The source pane displays the source code associated with 
the current entity selected in the navigation pane. When a performance 
database is first opened with hpcviewer, the source pane is initially 
blank because no entity is selected in the navigation pane. Selecting 
any entity in the navigation pane will cause the source pane to load the 
corresponding file, scroll to and highlight the line corresponding to the 
selection. Switching the source pane to view to a different source file 
is accomplished by making another selection in the navigation pane. 
</li>
<li> <b>Navigation pane</b>. The navigation pane presents a hierarchical tree- 
based structure that is used to organize the presentation of an applications's 
 performance data. Entities that occur in the navigation pane's 
tree include load modules, files, procedures, procedure activations, inlined code, loops, and source lines. Selecting any of these entities will 
cause its corresponding source code (if any) to be displayed in the 
source pane. One can reveal or conceal children in this hierarchy by 
"opening" or "closing" any non-leaf (i.e., individual source line) entry 
in this view. 
<p>
The nature of the entities in the navigation pane's tree structure depends
 upon whether one is exploring the calling context view, the 
callers view, or the flat view of the performance data. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> In the <b>calling context view</b>, entities in the navigation tree represent 
procedure activations, inlined code, loops, and source lines. While 
most entities link to a single location in source code, procedure 
activations link to two: the call site from which a procedure was 
called and the procedure itself. </li>
<li> In the <b>callers view</b>, entities in the navigation tree are procedure 
activations. Unlike procedure activations in the calling context 
tree view in which call sites are paired with the called procedure, 
in the caller's view, call sites are paired with the calling procedure 
to facilitate attribution of costs for a called procedure to multiple 
different call sites and callers. </li>
<li> In the <b>flat view</b>, entities in the navigation tree correspond to source 
files, procedure call sites (which are rendered the same way as 
procedure activations), loops, and source lines. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The header above the navigation pane contains some controls for the 
navigation and metric view. In Figure 1, they are labeled as "navigation/metric control". 
<ul>
 <li><img src="images/Flatten.gif"/> <b>Flatten / <img src="images/Unflatten.gif"/> unflatten</b>: These buttons are only available for flat view. They enable one to flatten and unflatten 
the navigation hierarchy. Clicking on the flatten button (the icon that 
shows a tree node with a slash through it) will replace each top-level 
scope shown with its children. If a scope has no children (i.e., it is a 
leaf ), the node will remain in the view. This flattening operation is 
useful for relaxing the strict hierarchical view so that peers at the same 
level in the tree can be viewed and ranked together. For instance, this 
can be used to hide procedures in the flat view so that outermost loops 
can be ranked and compared to one another. The inverse of the flatten 
operation is the unflatten operation, which causes an elided node in 
the tree to be made visible once again. 
</li>
 <li><b><img src="images/Zoom in large.gif"/> Zoom-in/ <img src="images/Zoom out large.gif"/> Zoom-out</b>: Depressing the up arrow button will zoom in to show only information
for the selected line and its descendants. One can zoom out 
(reversing a prior zoom operation) by depressing the down arrow button</li>

 <li><img src="images/flameIcon.gif"/> <b>Hot call path</b>: This accounts for cost of performance hot-spots, and is used to show the chain of responsibility for costs.
 The "hot spot" is computed by comparing parent and child values, and show the chain where the difference is greater that a threshold 
 (by default is <code>50%</code>). It is also possible to change the threshold value by clicking the menu "File-Preference".</li>
 
 <li><img src="images/FnMetric.gif"/> <b>Derived metric</b>: Creating a new metric based on mathematics expression formula. 
 See <a href="#derivedmetrics">Derived metrics</a> section for more details.</li>
 <li><img src="images/checkColumns.gif"/> <b>Show/hide metrics</b>: Showing and hiding metric columns. 
 A dialog box will appear, and user can select which columns to show or hide. See <a href="#hideshowcolumn">hide/show column</a> section for more details </li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li> <b>Metric pane</b>. The metric pane displays one or more performance metrics associated with entities to the left in the navigation pane. Entities 
in the tree view of the navigation pane are sorted at each level of the 
hierarchy by the metric in the selected column. When <i>hpcviewer</i> is 
launched, the leftmost metric column is the default selection and the 
navigation pane is sorted according to the values of that metric in de- 
scending order. One can change the selected metric by clicking on a 
column header. Clicking on the header of the selected column toggles 
the sort order between descending and ascending. 
<p>
During analysis, one often wants to consider the relationship between 
two metrics. This is easier when the metrics of interest are in adjacent 
columns of the metric pane. One can change the order of columns in 
the metric pane by selecting the column header for a metric and then 
dragging it left or right to its desired position. The metric pane also 
includes scroll bars for horizontal scrolling (to reveal other metrics) 
and vertical scrolling (to reveal other scopes). Vertical scrolling of the 
metric and navigation panes is synchronized. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="understandingmetrics"><h2>Understanding Metrics</h2></a>
<p>
The data gathered by profiler attributes the cost for each scope (a file, procedure, loop, or inlined function) exclusively. 
<i>hpcviewer</i> presents inclusive values for each cost metric associated with a program scope as well. 
Exclusive costs are those incurred by scope itself; whereas inclusive costs for a scope include costs incurred by 
any calls it makes. 
</p>

<h3>How metrics are computed ?</h3>
<p>Call path profile measurements collected by <i>hpcrun</i> correspond directly to the calling context view. <i>hpcviewer</i> 
derives all other views from exclusive metric costs in the calling context view. For the caller view, <i>hpcviewer</i> collects the 
cost of all samples in each function and attribute that to a top-level entry in the caller view. Under each top-level 
function, <i>hpcviewer</i> can look up the call chain at all of the context in which the function is called. For each function, <i>hpcviewer</i> 
apportions its costs among each of the calling contexts in which they were incurred. <i>hpcviewer</i> computes the flat view by 
traversing the calling context tree and attributing all costs for a scope to the scope within its static source code 
structure. The flat view presents a hierarchy of nested scopes from the load module, file, routine, loops, inlined 
code and statements. 
</p>

<p>
Figure 2 (a and b) shows an example of a recursive program separated into two files: <code>file1.c</code> and <code>file2.c</code> .
Routine <code>g</code> (Figure 2b) can behave as a recursive function depending on the value of the condition branch (Line 3-4).
Figure 3 shows an example of the call chain execution of the program annotated with both inclusive and exclusive costs. Computation of inclusive costs from exclusive costs in the calling context view involves simply summing up all of the costs in the subtree below.
</p>
<p>
In this figure, we can see that on the right path of the routine <code>m</code>, routine <code>g</code>
(instantiated in the diagram as <code>g<sub>1</sub></code>) performed a recursive call (<code>g<sub>2</sub></code>) before calling routine <code>h</code> (in this figure, we use numerical subscripts to distinguish between different instances of the same procedure. In the other parts of this figure, we use alphabetic subscripts. We use different labels because there is no natural one-to-one correspondence between the instances in the different views.) 
Although <code>g<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>g<sub>2</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>3</sub></code> are all instances from the same routine (i.e., <code>g</code>), we attribute  a different cost for each instance.
This separation of cost can be critical to identify which instance has a performance problem. 
</p>
<p>
Figure 4 shows the corresponding scope structure for the caller view and the costs we compute for this recursive program. The procedure <code>g</code> noted as <code>g<sub>a</sub></code> (which is a root node in the diagram), has different cost to <code>g</code> as a callsite as noted as <code>g<sub>b</sub></code>, <code>g<sub>c</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>d</sub></code>. 
For instance, on the first tree of this figure, the inclusive cost of  <code>g<sub>a</sub></code> is <code>9</code>, which is the sum of the highest  cost for each branch in calling context tree (Figure 3):  the inclusive cost of  <code>g<sub>3</sub></code> (which is <code>3</code>) and <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> (which is <code>6</code>).
We do not attribute the cost of <code>g<sub>2</sub></code> here since it is a descendant of <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> (in other term, the cost of <code>g<sub>2</sub></code> is included in <code>g<sub>1</sub></code>). 

</p>
<p>
Inclusive costs need to be computed similarly in the flat view. The inclusive cost of a recursive routine is the sum of the highest cost for each branch in calling context tree.
For instance, in Figure 5, The inclusive cost of <code>g<sub>x</sub></code>, defined as the total cost of all instances of <code>g</code>, is <code>9</code> and this is consistently the same as the cost in caller tree.
The advantage of attributing different cost for each instance of <code>g</code> is that it enables user to identify which instance is the responsible for performance losses.

<a name="derivedmetrics"><h2>Derived Metrics</h2></a>

<p>
Frequently, the data become useful only when combined with other information such as the number of instructions executed or 
the total number of cache accesses. 
While users don't mind a bit of mental arithmetic and frequently compare values in different 
columns to see how they relate for a scope, doing this for many scopes is exhausting. 
To address this problem, <i>hpcviewer</i> provides a mechanism for defining derived metrics. 
A derived metric is defined by specifying a spreadsheet-like mathematical formula that 
refers to data in other columns in the metric table by using <code>$n</code> to refer to the value in the <code>n</code><sup>th</sup> column.
</p>

<h3>Formula</h3>
<p>
The formula supported by hpcviewer is mainly inspired by spreadsheet-like mathematical formula, and can be in any form of combined complex expression.
The syntax is very simple:
<blockquote>
 <pre>
&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;binary_op&gt; | &lt;function&gt; 
&lt;binary_op&gt; ::= &lt;expression&gt; &lt;binary_operand&gt; &lt;expression&gt;
&lt;binary_operand&gt; ::= + | - | * | /
 </pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Intrinsic Functions</h4>
The list of intrinsic functions supported can be found in <a href="functions.html">here</a>.
In order to create a new intrinsic function, user can access to the source code, or by sending email to laksono@rice.edu.

<h3>Examples</h3>
Assuming the database contains the information of 5 processes, each has two metrics: 
<ol>
	<li>Metric 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8: total number of cycles</li>
	<li>Metric 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9: total number of floating point computation</li>
</ol>
In order to compute the average number of cycles of a floating point, we can define a formula as follows:
<blockquote>
 <pre>
avg($0, $2, $4. $6. $8) / avg($1, $3, $5, $7, $9)
 </pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Derived metric dialog box</h3>
<p>
A derived metric can be created by clicking the  <b>Derived metric</b> tool item in the navigation/control pane. 
A derived metric window will then appear as shown in Figure 6 below. 
<center>
<img src="images/DerivedMetricDlg.png"/><br/>
Figure 6: Derived metric dialog box
</center>
The window is comprised of two main parts:
<ol>
 <li><b>Derived metric definition</b>, which consists of:
  <ul>
    <li><i>Formula definition field</i>. In this field user can define a formula with spreadsheet-like mathematical formula. This field is required to be filled.</li>
    <li><i>Metric help</i>. This is used to help user to find the <i>ID</i> of a metric. 
    For instance, in this snapshot, the metric <code>PAPI_TOT_CYC</code> has the ID <code>44</code>. 
    By clicking the button <b>Insert metric</b>, the metric ID will be inserted in formula definition field.</li>
    <li><i>Function help</i>. This help is to guide user to insert a function in the formula definition field. 
    Some functions require only one metric as the argument, but some can have two or more arguments.
    For instance, the function <code>avg()</code> which computes the average of some metrics, need to have two arguments.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>Options</b>, which consists of two fields:
   <ul>
   	<li><i>New name for the derived metric</i>. This field assigns the title of the metric in the table.</li>
   	<li><i>Display the metric percentage</i>. When the field is checked, the percentage of a metric will be computed and displayed. 
   	To some cases, it is useful to have the percentage displayed. However, for some formula with multiplication, it does not make sense to have the percentage.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
</p>


<a name="metriccolumns"><h2>For Convenience Sake</h2></a>
<p>In this section we describe some functionalities that are not critical but they are important for improving productivity and convenience.
</p>

<h3>Editor pane</h3>
<p>
The editor pane can be used to display source codes or XML database.
Since its main purpose is to display source codes, the editor is not editable. User needs to open an editor (vim, emacs, etc. ) in order to edit the file. 
Sometimes it is important for user to look for a specific location or specific keyword. For this, hpcviewer provides (thanks to Eclipse) some functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Go to line</b>: to allow user to scroll the view into a specific line number. This functionality can be invoked using <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-l</code> shortcut.</li>
  <li><b>Find</b>: to allow user to find a specific keyword inside the current file. This function is invoked using <code>&lt;ctr&gt;-f</code> shortcut.</li> 
  <li><b>Changing font</b>: to allow user to change the font of the editor. A user needs to access the menu File-Preference to show the Preference dialog box.</li>
  <li><b><img src="images/Maximize.png"> Maximizing/<img src="images/Minimize.png">Minimizing</b>: to maximize or minimize the editor. These icon are on the right side of the editor.</li>
</ul>

<a name="metricpane"><h3>Metric pane</h3></a>
<p>
For the metric pane, hpcviewer provides some functionalities for user convenience:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Maximizing view</b>. Maximizing a view can be done by double-clicking the title of the view or clicking the <i>maximize</i> icon <img src="images/Maximize.png"/> 
 (located on the right side of the pane). 
 	To return the original view size, user can double click the title again.<br/>
 	</li>
 <li><b>Sorting column</b>. In order to sort a column, one has to click the header of the column. 
 The first click will sort the column in descending order, and the second column will sort in ascending order.</li>
 <li><b>Changing column width</b>. One can change the width of the column by dragging the cursor from the border of the column header into the desired width.</li>
 <li><b>Changing column order</b>. It is possible to switch the column order by dragging the column header into the desired position.</li>
 <li><b>Hiding or showing metric columns</b>. This functionality is useful to help user to focus on certain metrics.</li> 
</ul>

<p>In order to help users to focus on some metrics, hpcviewer provide a functionality to hide/show some metric columns. 
By clicking on the icon <b>Show/hide metrics</b>, a dialog box will appear as shown below. 
</p>
<center><img src="images/HideShowColumns.png" /><br/>
Figure 7: Hide/Show columns dialog box
</center>
<p>
The dialog box contains a list of metric columns sorted based on the original structure from hpcprof. 
Each metric column is prefixed by a check box to indicate if the metric should be <i>displayed</i> (if checked) or <i>hidden</i> (unchecked).
In order to display all metric columns, user can click the <b><Check all </b> button. A click to <b>Uncheck all</b> will hide all the metric columns.<br/>
Finally, an option <b>Apply to all views</b> will set the configuration into all views when checked. 
Otherwise, the configuration will be applied only on the current view. 
</p>
