HPCViewer Install Notes
========================

Requirements:
- Java 1.5 (at least)
- GTk 


1. Linux/Unix

To install hpcviewer, unpack the tar file, cd into its directory (the
directory containing this README file) and run:

   ./install [-j java-dir] install-dir

where 'java-dir' is a Java jdk or jre directory, and 'install-dir' is
the directory in which to install.  The java-dir is optional, but
install-dir is required.  Run the install script from its own
directory as ./install.

If you use '-j java-dir', then the install script captures the java
bin directory and adds it to PATH in the hpcviewer launch script.
This ensures that hpcviewer always uses the same version of Java.
Without this option, then hpcviewer will use whatever version of java
is first on your PATH.

It is possible to install hpcviewer in either the same install
directory as hpctoolkit (where install-dir is the prefix directory
from hpctoolkit's configure) or in a separate directory.
