/** 
 * The viewer window manager keeps track of which performance databases have been opened for each 
 * window created by the hpcviewer.
 * 
 * When a window is created it creates a new ViewerWindow class and (normally) adds it to end of the vWindows vector.  
 * The index into this vector will be used as the window number and its value+1 (so the first window will have a
 * window number of 1 instead of 0) will be used in the window title.  When windows are closed its entry in the 
 * vector will be set to null so that it does not affect the window number of other windows in the vector.  When 
 * a new ViewerWindow is being added to the vector it will reuse a slot in the vector which has a null value if 
 * such an entry exists.  The ViewerWindow class will keep track of all the databases opened (using the Database class) 
 * in that window.  This allows us to provide a list of databases which can be closed for each window.  It also gives 
 * us a place to keep track of the experiment data for each opened database.
